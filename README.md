## License
This software is distributed under the [MIT][mit license] license.

## Installation:
To play these games you need to have [PHP][php download] and [Composer][composer installation] have been installed on your machine.

For Windows users I would recommend to use [WSL][wsl installation] and all your programming related stuff do there.
If you have them, then clone the project or download a zip file and extract on your machine.

All your commands you must type in the root directory of the project. The place where the project has the `Makefile`.

At first, install dependencies. Type this command to do that:

`make install`

After that, you can launch any game with following commands:
```
  make brain-even
  make brain-cal
  make brain-gcd
  make brain-progression
  make brain-prime
```
